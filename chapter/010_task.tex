\chapter*{Task}

JavaScript allows to overwrite objects and functions, including native APIs of the web browser. This possibility is legitimately used by so-called “polyfills” to add support for API functionality to browsers that do not yet support specific features natively. However, the ability to overwrite APIs or other library functions can also be abused by attackers to trick a website into running malicious code rather than the legitimate browser API\@.

The task of this thesis is to investigate abilities and implications of such overwriting of browser APIs in web applications. To assess the current extent and relevance of this problem, the thesis should perform an empirical evaluation of the prevalence of API overwriting on real-world websites. Additionally, the thesis should design and implement an automated architecture to analyze websites for API overwriting. Besides allowing to perform the empirical evaluation, the architecture should also support web application developers or users in assessing potential overwrite-related problems of a website.
